# wind-farm-power-analysis
A full analysis of the power output and flow patterns in a simulated wind farm based on the FLORIS, FlOw Redirection and Induction in Steady state, model. 

The main_script file generates a coordinate plot of the wind farm layout, a flow velocity surface plot, a graph of power output by onset wind direction and a graph of the yearly power output variations

The farm_layout function generates a an array of turbine nacelle positions for use with the floris model.
